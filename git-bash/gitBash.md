# Git Bash

## Set Up Instructions

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (if you don't have it already)
2. Open your terminal:
    - for windows: this will be Git Bash
    - for mac: this will be the Terminal (you can find it by searching "Terminal" via the search icon in the upper right hand corner of your screen)
3. Now you can do the following excercises!

### Excercises

* navigate to desktop
* make a folder
* get into that folder
* make 2 files
* show files in folder
* delete one file
* open folder in VSCode

#### Commands that you will use

* `ls` shows files for the folder you're currently in
* `cd "myFolderName"` moves the terminal into a folder
* `mkdir "myFolderName"` creates a folder/directory
* `touch "myFileName"` creates a file
* `rm "myFileName` removes a file
    -  Be incredibly careful with this command. It performs a hard delete so anything you delete will not be accessible to you again.
* `code .` opens your current folder in Visual Studio Code
