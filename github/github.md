# Fun with Github

## Set Up
1. Make sure you have a [Github account](https://github.com/login?return_to=%2Fjoin) and confirm login
    - if you don't have an account, [create one!](https://github.com/join)
2. In your git terminal, set your username with the following command:
    - (replace your_name_here with your preferred username in quotes):
    ` git config --global user.name "your_name_here" ` 
3. Again, in your terminal, set your email with the following command:
    - (replace your_email@email.com with your own email in quotes)
    ` git config --global user.email "your_email@email.com" `
4. Now you need to set up your SSH keys. Doing this creates a secure connection to Github and verifies your identity so that you don't need to confirm it every time. 
    - github has some documentation on this [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
    - For Windows users: [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgZIv5HI44o) is super helpful and simple
    - For Mac users: [this document](https://www.e2enetworks.com/help/knowledge-base/sshgenerating-a-key-pair-for-mac/) does a great job at walking you through it
5. Once you're connected, you will be able to create repositories, commit, pull and push code and have a lot of fun!
