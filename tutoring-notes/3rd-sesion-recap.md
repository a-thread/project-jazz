## Recap of 12/31/20:
- we learned about flexbox!
- we learned about parent/child relationships
- we changed the styling of a list in our style.css:
   - altered the margin:
   - altered the padding
   - removed the list decoration:
   ` ul { list-style-type: none; } `
   - set the styling of the parent element to a flex display: ` ul { display: flex; } `
- learned about the automatic style for flex:
   - unless we set a flex-direction, flexbox will default to "row"
